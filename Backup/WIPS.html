        <div id="website"><h4 class="headerWIP">Website</h4><p>I started designing this website to learn html, and hope to continue working on it and improving it. It’s my first real project and though its pretty basic, its a foot in the door. I am currently using a text editor called Brackets. Its interface is clean and easy to use making it a great first text editor to use.

            <ol> <img id="bracketsimg" src="brackets6.gif">
            <li>Spice up the design. Currently the website is lacking in its styling has no real look, I am going to look to change that in the future.

                        <li>Animations</li><li>Borders and dividers</li><li>A real logo</li></ul></li>
            <li>Actual Content- The actual content isn’t  as important because its mean to help me learn html, however its hard to learn without any real content to work with.

        <h4 class="headerWIP">XCode</h4><p></img>I'm a fan of clean interfaces and OS intergreation in web apps. I wanted to bring the social media website that I use, “reddit” to the desktop. However the only app available was 20 dollars. I decided then to try my hand at producing an app for the OSX. Essentially a stand alone app which will parse info from the site, Reddit, and present it in a much graphically easier manner.</p><p>XCode to-do list</p>
