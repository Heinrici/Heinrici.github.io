**Goverment Corporation and Union**

	Goverments proposed in todays world promise freedom and equality. Systematic inequality and opression usually go hand in hand. 


Keep in mind the following argument is based on ethical principles of the individual man not greater society. Whats being argued is the morality of taxation, not the economic consequences of it. After all economics is based on values, so determing ethical principles takes precedent over the applied economic consequences of reducing or increacing taxes. 

	Man has the right to the fruits of his labour
	Taking someones right is immoral
	Therefore taking the fruits of someones labour is immoral
	Taxation is taking some of a mans property through force or the threat of it. 
	Taxation is immoral
	
Those who defend taxation say that it is a neccescary evil, that taxation is for the greater good of society, whatver that may mean. However, that doesnt make it right, in fact its suggesting that taxation is evil. Should we force ourselvles to such a fate, doing soemthing immorally wrong everyday. 


We have established that taxes are immoral, however without taxees we are confronted with 

However, it is true that goverment can be a force for good




Labors-Union
Capital- Capitalist Corporation
Land- Goverment 


Goverment would make money through rent. Georgism
Labor through argreements with coporation
coporation through selling its good to the public. 

Competition between labor unions would create the best union for the people and corporation. Goverment would insure no threat of violence between unions and corporations.  



One kind of opression is neither better nor worse then another
